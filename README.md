# SalesReportApp
This app uses a rectangular or 2D array for a table of sales figures that are by Region and Quarter.  Next it pulls the totals out for each Region. After that it pulls the totals for each Quarter. Lastly it gives a final sales total for the year.
Prior to the code are the instructions that were followed to create the code.
The code written prints to the console exactly as the instructions indicate.
